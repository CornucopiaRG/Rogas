Rogas is a project for Network Analytics

## Latest news 
Rogas is now joining the Google Summer of Code 2016. In the following months, we aim to develop a new GUI for Rogas with more comprehensive network visualisation functions and also implement "Local Community Detection Search" for Rogas. We will upload new source code after the new GUI and functions have been achieved. For who wants to have a sneak peak, please refer to https://github.com/shallyan/GSoC-Rogas.

## Introduction
Rogas not only can provides a high-level declarative query language to 
formulate analysis queries, but also can unify different graph algorithms 
within the relational environment for query processing.
<br>
<br>
The Rogas has three main components: (1) a hybrid data model, which 
integrates graphs with relations so that we have these two types of data 
structures respectively for network analysis and relational analysis; 
(2) a SQL-like query language, which extends standard SQL with 
graph constructing, ranking, clustering, and path finding operations; 
(3) a query engine, which is built upon PostgreSQL and can efficiently process 
network analysis queries using various graph systems and 
their supporting algorithms.
<br>
<br>
Here is the prototype implementation of the Rogas. The prototype
is developed in **Python 2.7** with the official PostgreSQL client library â€“ libpq. 
We use **Psycopg**, the current mature wrapper for the libpq, as the 
PostgreSQL adapter. For the GUI, we use **TkInter**, **PIL**, and **pylsytable**
for window development, image formating and table-like printing. In terms of 
graph algorithms, currently, we take advantage of **Graph-tool**, **SNAP** and 
**NetworkX** for algorithms support.
<br>
<br>
Here are the links for the python packages mentioned above:
<br>
(suggest to use Ubuntu or other Linux systems, Mac and Windows are hard to install all these packages)
* Psycopg: http://initd.org/psycopg/
* TkInter: https://wiki.python.org/moin/TkInter
* Pillow for PIL: https://python-pillow.github.io/  (Require Pillow 3.1 or above)
* pylsytable: https://github.com/Leviathan1995/Pylsy?files=1
* Graph-tool: http://graph-tool.skewed.de/
* SNAP: http://snap.stanford.edu/snappy/index.html
* NetworkX: http://networkx.github.io/  

<br>
Before runing the prototype, ensure the system is Ubuntu and all the external 
python packages mentioned above are installed correctly. 
<br>
<br>
**Notice that pillow is 
the latest package for PIL and it is not compatible with the old PIL package. 
If your have already had PIL in your python dist-packages (/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/),
please delete the original PIL and install the new Pillow package. If you are using Eclipse or 
other IDE, I suggest to use the source code to install Pillow so that the unresolved import 
issues of the IDE can be solved.**
<br>
<br>
You also need to change the code of the *queryConsole.start()* method a bit 
to connect your own PostgreSQL database. Then you can start the prototype 
by running the *GUI_Console* program.
<br>
<br>
More details about the Rogas, please refer to 
the thesis "Towards a Unified Framework for Network Analytics" collected in 
Australian National University (http://users.cecs.anu.edu.au/~u5170295/publications/thesis-minjian.pdf). You can also 
contact *minjian.liu@anu.edu.au* or *qing.wang@anu.edu.au* for more information.
<br>
<br>
PS: For answering how to change the output of the GUI_Console as left alignment (default is center alignment)
You can change the source code of the pylsytable as follow:(the path in Ubuntu normally is 
'/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/pylsy/pylsy.py).
<br>
* Find the "def _pad_string(self, str, colwidth):" function in the pylsy.py
* change " return ' ' * prefix + str +' ' * suffix " (center alignment ) as " return str + ' ' * prefix +' ' * suffix " (left alignment)
